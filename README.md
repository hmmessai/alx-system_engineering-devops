## ALX System Engineering Devops
The ALX software engineering programme I am participating tasked me with these projects about System Enginnering using Linux distributions. Below are the projects I did as solutions to the problems raised.
### [Shell Basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
Scripts containing basic shell commands.
### [Shell Permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user.In this project we will play with the permissions linux provide us and solve some problems.
### [Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters](./0x02-shell_redirections)
We explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection.
We learned about filters take standard input and perform an operation upon it and send the results to standard output and other features used by command line programs.
### [Shell, init files, variables and expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
Exploring some concepts of - Shell Arithemtic
			- Variables in shell
			- Shell Initialization files
			- Aliasing
			- Expansions
### [Loops, conditions and parsing](./0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing)
Worked on loops conditions and parsing in a shell environment(bash).
- Comparision operators
- File test operators
- Making scripts portable with 'code' env
- Variable assignment and arithmetic
### [Processes and Signals](./0x05-processes_and_signals)
- Linux PID
- Linux process
- Linux signal
- Process managment in linux
### [Regular Expressions](./0x06-regular_expressions)
Gone through some basic uses of 'regexp' and worked on some problems.
