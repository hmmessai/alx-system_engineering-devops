## Shell Permissions

In this project we will work and play with permissions of a file and directory. This includes group permissions, user permissions and root permissions. We will try different combinations of permissions with read, write and execute permission to the different groups, users and root.

1. [0-iam_betty](./0-iam_betty): switch current user to user betty
2. [1-who_am_i](./1-who_am_i): prints the current user
3. [2-groups](./2-groups): prints the groups the current user is in
4. [3-new_owner](./3-new_owner): assigns a new owner for file hello
5. [4-empty](./4-empty): create and empty file hello in the current directory
6. [5-execute](./5-execute): gives the user an executable permission to the hello file
7. [6-multiple_permissions](./6-multiple_permissions): gives execute permission to group and owner while giving read access to other users for the file hello
8. [7-everybody](./7-everybody): give execute permission for all users for the file hello
9. [8-James_Bond](./8-James_Bond): gives all the permissions to other users but no permission to group and owner
10. [9-John_Doe](./9-John_Doe): gives every permission to owner, read and execute for group and write and execute for other users
11. [10-mirror_permissions](./10-mirror_permissions): mirror permissions from the olleh file to hello file
12. [11-directories_permissions](./11-directories_permissions): changes the permission of the current direcories sub directories to execute
